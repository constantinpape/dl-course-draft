# Day 4

## Content
On the fourth day, we will look at the models for object detection. In particular we're going to introduce R-CNN
and its variants as well as present some of the newest approaches to object detection.
The lectures will cover ([you can find the slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19CO75925rmh7nwlnCPHCBqtaUb5Db_OOEUzIj1omfXw/edit?usp=sharing):
- Introduction to R-CNN
- R-CNN variants
- End-to-end Object Detection with Transformers

### Advanced Exercises:
In the afternoon we're going to start working on advanced exercises which are described [here](../exercises/README.md),
in particular the object detection exercise can be found [here](../exercises/object-detection-transformers.md)
