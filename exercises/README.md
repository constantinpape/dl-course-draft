# Longer Exercises

On the last day, you should work on a larger exercise (without a notebook template) by yourself, building on the material we have covered in the course.
You are welcome to choose the topic of this exercise yourself and also work on data of your own choosing.
We have also prepared some ideas for longer exercises:

- [Solve a 3D segmentation problem on data from plant biology](https://github.com/constantinpape/training-deep-learning-models-for-vison/blob/master/exercises/3d-segmentation.md)
- [Contrastive learning for visual representations](https://github.com/constantinpape/training-deep-learning-models-for-vison/blob/master/exercises/contrastive-learning.md)
- [Object Detection with Transformers on Pascal VOC 2012](./object-detection-transformers.md)

## Mounting your google drive in colab

For the exercises that require longer training or need large datasets, it is better to have permanent storage for access to larger datasets or to save model checkpoints.
To get permanent storage in google colab, you can mount your google drive.
Check out the notebook [mount-gdrive-in-colab.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/training-deep-learning-models-for-vison/blob/master/exercises/mount-gdrive-in-colab.ipynb) for instructions.
It also shows how to save and load model checkpoints for training.
