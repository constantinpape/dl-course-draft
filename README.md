A compact course on using deep learning methods for computer vision.
Based on material from the [EMBL deep learning course](https://github.com/kreshuklab/teaching-dl-course-2019).

See the [course website](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/ial/adl) for details on the version of this course taught at Heidelberg University in October 2020.

## Requirements

In order to follow this course you should have basic knowledge of machine learning and/or computer vision and have python programming experience.
The course will be taught using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#), in order to use it you need a google account. 
Some free space on your google drive (~ 1GB) will be benefitial [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/).
